Crimson Tide ended at 11-2 back then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the special event of the nine years, the team won 11 or more games. For the first time in college history, Nick Saban was not in the top four teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been following Alabama, you might have seen the schedule of the games, dates, times, and other information. But as the pandemic stroke, all of them are to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous year was amazing. Alabama went 11-2 after winning over Michigan in the Citrus Bowl. In six years, it was the first time the team missed the opportunity to get into the College Football Playoff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the 2020 NFL Draft, Alabama lost their four key players in the first round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The familiar names are losing such as Tua Tagovailoa as the quarterback to Dolphins, Jedrick Wills the offensive to Browns, as well as Henry Ruggs III and Jerry Jeudy to Raiders and Broncos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alabama finished the second back then. But because of losing their four key players, they wouldn\u2019t need to makeover the team entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason is simple. They have a promising squad with good records.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their quarterback, Mac Jones, had a great start in four games in the 2019 year. He managed to throw 14 touchdowns against three interceptions. Jones is one of the leaders in the Alabama team as the shot caller. But of course, the working tandem is important for the Alabama team with Bryce Young as the freshman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce Young will be a great key player to retain the starting tasks for the team. There is no need to reset the entire squad to expect what\u2019s coming to the upcoming event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great name improves the morale of the team: Najee Harris. After Ruggs and Jeudy are gone, the receiver leader will be relevant to Devonta Smith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a prospect for Smith to replace the top receiver, Jaylen Waddle for the better jump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong>  <a href=\"https:\/\/ncaafootballinfo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Watch National Champioship 2020 Online?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defensive back Patrick Surtain II is one of the renowned players to return on the other side of the ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the preseason top 25, Alabama is sitting at the third rank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is that Alabama still has a great offense although Tua Togavailoa isn\u2019t in the team anymore. No matter how the team will line up at the quarterback, the Crimson Tide still has one of the best national offenses.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alabama would make the first appearance in the first game on Saturday, November 21, when they take on Kentucky.
