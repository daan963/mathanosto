Dhaka&#8217;s vice-captain Taskin is great in the upcoming BPL. Faced with the media on Thursday, he also expressed his desire to lead the national team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, &#8216;Yes, of course. Why not, every player has a dream. Everything will happen step by step. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding being the co-captain of Dhaka, Taskin said, &#8216;Our team is very young. Sujan Sir is there, Mosaddek is there, I am also there, there are many other experienced cricketers. May be subject to availability many foreign cricketers will arrive late, some may not be available on time. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If we can organize the existing team and play with unity, it will definitely be a good thing. I will always try to share my own experiences for the team. So that our team will benefit. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great Dhaka could not build a very strong team in this year&#8217;s BPL. Taskin is the biggest star of the team. However, Taskin is hoping for good things with the team. He wants to do something useful for his performance as well as the team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Taskin said, &#8216;Actually in T20 cricket, on a given day, you always have to play according to the situation. Apart from that, sometimes not much happens. From tomorrow our tournament will start the goal will be the same thing another new season is starting always the same game just the name is BPL. There is always pressure in the game. \u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can use the power that I have, nothing new. At the end of the day, the result will count how well I can perform. Keeping the basics right and sharpening my performance to be effective for the team. &#8216;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Injuries and injuries have never left Taskin Ahmed behind.
