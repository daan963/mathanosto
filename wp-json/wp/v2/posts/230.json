Alabama will take on Georgia in the <a href=\"https:\/\/ncaafootballinfo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Championship game<\/a> after they had a victory over Michigan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alabama vs Georgia Start Time, TV channel and Live Stream<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The starting time is around 8 p.m. ET. Expect a slight late or early start time. Not to mention, converting to your local time is necessary to make sure that you won\u2019t miss the spectacle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The date is Monday, January 10, 2022. Make sure to circle the game on your calendar so that you can follow it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the TV channel, ESPN has managed to reserve the full rights to the broadcast. Tune into the ESPN channel to see the full coverage. You could also use your ESPN credentials to watch it online at ESPN.com\/Watch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve cut the cord, consider using TV streaming services that include ESPN in your location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/livecollegefootball.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/ncaafootballinfo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Alabama-vs-Georgia-live-stream.png\" alt=\"Alabama vs Georgia Live Stream\" class=\"wp-image-231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ncaafootballinfo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Alabama-vs-Georgia-live-stream.png 640w, https:\/\/ncaafootballinfo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Alabama-vs-Georgia-live-stream-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of cord-cutter options. But not all of the providers offer an equal quality of service. It could take a long time to hand-pick the option by yourself. Or instead, you will want to focus on the best options available out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are top-rated TV streaming services that you\u2019d like to check out, such as DirecTV Stream, FuboTV, YouTube TV, Sling TV, and Hulu. If you choose one of them, you can\u2019t go wrong because they are top-rated services. But if you want to have the most affordable one, Sling TV could be a great option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many sports lovers recommend FuboTV since this provider has such a huge dedication to sports channels. You could also use its free trial program if you are a new user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alabama vs Georgia Game Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alabama and Georgia will compete for the College Football Playoff national championship. This time, a rematch of the SEC Championship Game, which took place on December 4th, will take place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The title game will be held on January 10th at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (7 p.m. CT, ESPN).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, Georgia (13-1) upset No. 2 Michigan (12-2) 34-11 in the Orange Bowl semi-finals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Alabama&#8217;s 41-24 victory over Georgia in the SEC championship game, the two teams will square off in the national championship game. Georgia&#8217;s season came to an end with a loss against Alabama. Alabama scored 24 points in the second quarter to construct a halftime lead it would not surrender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The No. 1 Crimson Tide (13-1) defeated No. 4 Cincinnati (13-1) 27-6 in the Cotton Bowl quarterfinal. Alabama dominated Cincinnati&#8217;s running game to clinch the victory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was Alabama&#8217;s first loss of the season, although the Crimson Tide had already defeated LSU and Arkansas before edging off Auburn in four overtimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Alabama wins, it will be the first time a team has repeated as champion since the Alabama teams of 2011 and 2012. Tua Tagovailoa came off the bench in the 2017 CFP championship game to help Alabama come from behind to win in overtime and the title game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The winner of the 2021 College Football Playoff has already been determined. Alabama and Georgia will meet for the second time this season on Monday, Jan. 10, in Indianapolis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alabama will face Nick Saban for the eighth time in their history. It&#8217;s been seven years since the Bulldogs beat Nick Saban&#8217;s Crimson Tide back in 2007.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous time these two faced off was in the SEC Championship, when Alabama won 41-24 over Georgia. The Bulldogs suffered their first loss of the season and surrendered their most points yet (17).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alabama earned a spot in the Cotton Bowl by defeating No. 4 Cincinnati earlier in the day, 27-6. RB: Brian Robinson Jr. led the Crimson Tide with 204 yards on 26 carries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick Saban&#8217;s defense was superb all day, surrendering only 218 offensive yards (76 in the first half). They also put a lot of pressure on Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ridder. The Tide sacked Ridder six times in the triumph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the nightcap of the Orange Bowl, Georgia upset No. 2 Michigan, 34-11. The Bulldogs&#8217; attack was mostly based on the passing game. As a quarterback, Stetson Bennett threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Dawgs&#8217; defense was great throughout the game. Hassan Haskins of Michigan was held to 39 yards on the ground against Georgia. Georgia also forced turnovers in the win, intercepting Michigan quarterback Cade McNamara twice and recovering a fumble.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you are a huge fan of Alabama or Georgia, you have come to the right page to expect the upcoming championship game.
