										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2000, model and TV host Heidi Klum has thrown an elaborate annual Halloween bash, and 2023 is no different.</p>
<p>Klum&#8217;s star-studded spooky season event kicks off at Marquee, a nightclub in New York City, on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>As always, plenty of A-listers are expected to show up in their scariest looks. This year also features a DJ set by Questlove.</p>
<p>Klum&#8217;s party has happened every year since the turn of the millennium, with the exception of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Ahead of the party, Klum revealed to TODAY.com that her look this year is &#8220;very, very big and very colorful.&#8221; She added that she tries to find “unusual costumes” that are different from anything she’s ever done — a tall order for someone who has been making headlines for her unusual spooky season looks for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Follow along here for all of this year&#8217;s looks and news from the red carpet of Klum&#8217;s annual boo-tastic bash! <img src="../../../../s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f47b.png" alt="👻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
