										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2000, model and TV host Heidi Klum has thrown an elaborate annual Halloween bash, and 2023 is no different.</p>
<p>Klum&#8217;s star-studded spooky season event kicks off at Marquee, a nightclub in New York City, on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>As always, plenty of A-listers are expected to show up in their scariest looks. This year also features a DJ set by Questlove.</p>
<p>Klum&#8217;s party has happened every year since the turn of the millennium, with the exception of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Ahead of the party, Klum revealed to TODAY.com that her look this year is &#8220;very, very big and very colorful.&#8221; She added that she tries to find “unusual costumes” that are different from anything she’s ever done — a tall order for someone who has been making headlines for her unusual spooky season looks for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Follow along here for all of this year&#8217;s looks and news from the red carpet of Klum&#8217;s annual boo-tastic bash! <img src="../../s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f47b.png" alt="👻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European markets logged the worst monthly performance since September 2022 in October, despite making gains on the last day of the month, as investors assess a flurry of economic data and earnings.</p>
<p>The regional Stoxx 600<br />
ended 0.6% higher, with sectors mostly higher. The index has shed more than 4% in October, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Oil and gas stocks were down 0.8% as BP’s London-listed shares closed 4.5% lower after it missed third quarter estimates. Brewers AB InBev and Carlsberg<br />
both reported lower sales yet higher revenue for the period due to pricing offsets.</p>
<p>Euro zone inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.9% in October, preliminary data showed Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expected 3.1%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, statistics agency Eurostat said the euro zone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, below a forecast of stagnation.</p>
<p>The readings come after the European Central Bank last week paused its record run of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes.</p>
<p>In Asia-Pacific markets, Japanese stocks ended higher after the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decision, while other regional markets fell as manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in China.</p>
<p>In the U.S. the S&amp;P 500 was little changed , with stocks set to close out a dismal month that saw Treasury yields surge to multiyear highs. The broader index dipped 0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down by 0.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 53 points, or 0.18%.</p>

Vodafone to sell Spanish operations for $5.3 billion<br />
Telecoms group Vodafone<br />
announced Tuesday it has entered a binding agreement with Zegona Communications for the 5 billion euro ($5.3 billion) sale of its Spanish business.</p>
<p>The deal for 100% of Vodafone Spain comprises 4.1 billion euros in cash and up to 900 million euros in Redeemable Preference Shares, which allow the repayment of principal share capital to shareholders.</p>
<p>Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle said in a statement: “The sale of Vodafone Spain is a key step in right-sizing our portfolio for growth and will enable us to focus our resources in markets with sustainable structures and sufficient local scale.”</p>
<p>Vodafone Group shares were 1% lower at 2:15 p.m. London time. Trading of Zegona Communications shares was suspended on Sept. 22.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel Hamas War LIVE Updates: A spokesperson from the UN Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), James Elder, warned of the risk of infant deaths due to dehydration, with water output at 5% of normal levels, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>About 940 children are reported missing in Gaza, he said, with some thought to be stuck beneath the rubble.</p>
<p>&#8220;So child deaths due to dehydration, particularly infant deaths due to dehydration, are a growing threat,&#8221; he said, adding that children were getting sick from drinking salty water.</p>
<p>At least 50 bodies were recovered from the rubble after an Israeli airstrike on the Jabalia refugee camp completely destroyed the shelter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gaza’s interior ministry reported the Jabalia refugee camp has been “completely destroyed&#8221; by Israeli bombardment.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken will head back to Israel on Friday and also visit other countries in the region.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Hamas is part of an axis of evil Iran has formed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel&#8217;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan characterized Hamas as a group with intentions similar to that of the ‘Nazis’ and emphasized that the organization does not appear to seek a resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>Erdan said that Hamas is interested in the annihilation of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s armed forces have reported conducting operations that targeted over 600 militant sites in recent days, as they escalate their ground actions in the region.</p>
<p>This comes at a critical juncture in the conflict, with Palestinian civilians facing severe shortages of essential supplies such as fuel, food, and safe drinking water, as the conflict enters its fourth week.</p>
<p>More than 8,300 people have been killed — 66% of them women and children – and tens of thousands injured, according to the latest figures from Gaza’s Ministry of Health.</p>

Israel-Hamas War LIVE Updates: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls upon Muslim countries to boycott Israel<br />
Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslim states to cease oil and food exports to Israel, demanding an end to its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, state media reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bombings on Gaza must stop immediately &#8230; the path of oil and food exports to the Zionist regime should be stopped,&#8221; Khamenei said in a speech, according to Iranian state media.</p>
<p>Israel has vowed to wipe out Tehran-backed Hamas, which rules Gaza, in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,400 people and saw hundreds taken hostage.</p>
<p>Israel has launched an unprecedented bombardment of Gaza and imposed a siege of the enclave. Palestinian authorities say more than 8,000 people have been killed.</p>
